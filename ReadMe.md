# Poller
A basic polling application that allows users to take part in polls; it also lets administrators set the questions using a GUI.


## Motivation
I used this project to learn the basics of the Django framework. (This project was created using [this guide](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) from Django.)


## Pre-requisites
The following tools are needed to run this application:
- [Python](www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/install/)


## Instruction
To run the application locally on Windows, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your machine.
2. Open Command Prompt and navigate to the project folder.
3. Enter the following command to run the local server: `py manage.py runserver`
